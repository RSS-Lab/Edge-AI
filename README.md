# Qemu
QEMU (Quick Emulator) is an open-source virtualization tool that allows you to run operating systems and programs designed for one architecture on a machine with a different architecture. It supports various CPU architectures, including x86, ARM, PowerPC, and RISC-V. QEMU simulates the target architecture at both the hardware level (like CPU and memory) and software level, enabling you to run software as if it were on actual hardware.

For RISC-V, QEMU provides a powerful simulator that allows developers to emulate RISC-V systems without needing physical RISC-V hardware. This is especially useful for development, testing, and debugging of RISC-V applications or operating systems in a virtualized environment. With QEMU's flexibility, you can simulate RISC-V systems of different configurations, from simple embedded devices to more complex setups, depending on your needs.
# Prerequisites
For the installation process, you'll need a Linux-based system. If you're on Windows, you can use WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) or VirtualBox to create a virtual machine with the necessary Linux environment.

Virtual Machine Specifications:
To set up your virtual machine, you can create a VM with the following specifications:

CPU: 2+ cores (depending on your system resources)

RAM: 4GB (minimum) or more

Storage: 50GB+ of disk space (to accommodate the Linux system and tools)

Operating System: A Linux distribution like Ubuntu 22.04 LTS

Once the VM is created, you'll be able to install QEMU and the required development tools on it. This setup will allow you to run simple C and assembly programs using the RISC-V emulator and use GDB to inspect and debug the contents of registers.

- To install **WSL** on Windows, you can follow the guide [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install).
- To install **Ubuntu** on VirtualBox, use this [guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4P0s9GtDDM).
